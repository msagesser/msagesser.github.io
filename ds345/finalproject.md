### Final Project

Each group will present a larger creative project primarily in sound: a 15-minute audio walk that is conceptualized, produced, presented, and documented at high quality.  

Requirements:  
- 15min duration
- format: 4-channel audio (2-channel bluetooth headphone, 2-channel outdoor loudspeaker)
- it has to respond, in some way, to the UABB proposal topic: Unwalking offers an event that engages the echo of the river flowing by the village that connects and transforms into an ecological system beyond the village.

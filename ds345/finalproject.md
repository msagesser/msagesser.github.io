Fall 2022

### Final Project

Each group will present a larger creative project primarily in sound: an audio walk that is conceptualized, produced, presented, and documented at high quality.  

#### Audio piece:
- Duration: 15min for headphones (25min for outdoor speakers)
- format: 4-channel audio (2-channel bluetooth headphones, 2-channel outdoor loudspeaker)
- it has to respond, in some way, to the UABB proposal topic: Unwalking offers an event that engages the echo of the river flowing by the village that connects and transforms into an ecological system beyond the village. 
- the genre is free: it can be an audio story telling, a museum-style audio guide, an audio tour, a soundscape composition, a sonic architecture, a narration/narrative, an abstract piece, etc. (whatever genre is chosen, the expectation is the highest possible quality)
- can be a fixed composition / sound design, or an interactive, non-linear sound design
- it must include a UI for mobile phones that controls the sound
- it needs to contain: at least 1 field recording, at least 1 synthetic sound (self-made)

#### Accompanying materials:
- map of the planned walking route
- script of the planned sound piece
- title, in response to "UNWALKING"
- description text (max 400 words)

#### Visual documentation:
- A visual interpretation of your audio walk must be produced as part of the final project
- format and genre are free: it can be a video that includes the actual audio piece in its sound track, or it can be a series of slide shows and graphical materials, such as time and space mappings, catalogued pictures, etc, or it can be a website (whatever format/genre is chosen, the highest quality is expected)
- The visual presentation, together with the sound, must give a full experience of the work, so that it can be exhibited elsewhere in the future

#### Interim Review:
- A rough draft of all parts of the project is expected
- Time for the interim review: 15 min per group (5 min of sound playback with or without visuals, 5 min of presentation, 5 min of Q&A)

# DS345 Sound Design
Fall 2022  

[back](index.md)  

### Final Project

Each group will present a larger creative project primarily in sound: an audio walk that is conceptualized, produced, presented, and documented at high quality.  

#### Audio piece:
- Duration: 15min for headphones (25min for outdoor speakers)
- format: 4-channel audio (2-channel bluetooth headphones, 2-channel outdoor loudspeaker)
- it has to respond, in some way, to the UABB proposal topic: Unwalking offers an event that engages the echo of the river flowing by the village that connects and transforms into an ecological system beyond the village. 
- the genre is free: it can be an audio story telling, a museum-style audio guide, an audio tour, a soundscape composition, a sonic architecture, a narration/narrative, an abstract piece, etc. (whatever genre is chosen, the expectation is the highest possible quality)
- can be a fixed composition / sound design, or an interactive, non-linear sound design
- it must include a UI for mobile phones that controls the sound
- it needs to contain: at least 1 field recording, at least 1 synthetic sound (self-made)

#### Accompanying materials:
- map of the planned walking route
- script of the planned sound piece
- title, in response to "UNWALKING"
- description text (max 400 words)

#### App UI / Web Audio Player
Each project must include an App UI / Web Audio Player that is made by you. The minimal requirement is a "start" button that starts the sound walk file (mp3), and a simple, professional-looking user interface for mobile phones, made with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Web Audio API (Tone.js).

#### Visual documentation:
- A visual interpretation of your audio walk must be produced as part of the final project
- format and genre are free: it can be a video that includes the actual audio piece in its sound track, or it can be a series of slide shows and graphical materials, such as time and space mappings, catalogued pictures, etc, or it can be a website (whatever format/genre is chosen, the highest quality is expected)
- The visual presentation, together with the sound, must give a full experience of the work, so that it can be exhibited elsewhere in the future

#### Address Learning Goals:
With your final project, please clearly demonstrate your skill/mastery according to the four learning goals:
1.	Critically describe the potential of sound in media applications
2.	Apply listening skill, audio and affect vocabulary to describe sound
3.	Present experimentation in sound generation, composition, and editing
4.	Propose, craft, and deliver their own high-quality creative project in sound

#### Interim Review:
- A rough draft of all parts of the project is expected
- Time for the interim review: 15 min per group (5 min of sound playback with or without visuals, 5 min of presentation, 5 min of Q&A)

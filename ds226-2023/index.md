# DS226. Circular Products: Experience

64 total hours: 32 hours of lecture, 32 hours of lab  
Language: English  


## Instructor

Assistant Professor  
School of Design, SUSTech, Shenzhen

## Course Description
In this course, students will learn the foundations of time-based digital media analysis and production. Using the framework of ‘cradle to cradle’ and circular economies, this course will ask how reusing and recycling of pre-existing materials might look like in digital media. Students will consider real-world situations for opportunities of design that require the production of time-based, intangible digital media experiences. In addition to receiving the basics of digital media editing, students will engage in English-language classroom discussion, they will work both individually and in groups, they will learn to analyze pre-existing digital media experiences, and they will receive demanding assignments to produce their own creative digital media experiences.

## Skills
Translational envisioning; reuse

## Learning Outcomes
1.	Describe ‘waste,’ ‘obsolete,’ and ‘decayed’ for materials across media and senses, in particular for intangible and time-based materials.
2.	Demonstrate understanding of ‘circular economies’ for time-based digital media, including the differences between synthesizing, reusing, recycling, referencing, citing, and appropriating.
3.	Define the difference between material/footage and process/mediation in time-based digital media.
4.	Present research of techniques that ‘translate’ ideas between multiple intangible materials.

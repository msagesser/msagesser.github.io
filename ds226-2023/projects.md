# DS226. Small Projects

**Assignment**  
"Small Projects" are considered the sum of small assignments that are conducted over the duration of this course. These include group and individual assignments, and they include creative, technical, academic, aesthetical, and presentation-related activities. What is graded is both the quality, the professionality, and each individual's committment to fulfilling the assignment. Over this course, in average there will be one "small project" per teaching day. These projects will always be announced as being part of the "small projects" grade.

**Small Project 1 (Group)**  
Create a small video (can be without sound) for the 8 LED panels in one row. Choose one of the three keywords – "waste," "obsolete," or "decayed" – and design an experience that responds to this keyword. The result should be a short video for a pixel resolution of 1280x80 that can be looped.

*Deadline for submitting the result to the submission folder: May 13, 23:59*


**Small Project 2 (Individual)**  
Create a small piece with (a) video/graphics made in Processing and (b) sound made in Adobe Audition. The project should thematize the idea of 'circular economy' in digital media (make something new of something old). The video should contain some parts of original code by you. It should be made for a square-shaped LED panel screen. The sound should contain some old, found, electronic sound, such as 8-bit sound, etc. The Duration should be between ~ 30sec and ~ 2min, and it should be a loop. **Submission:** submit the final video file (320 * 320 pixels) that contains sound. Include in your submission a PDF that contains the most important Processing code (with parts made by yourself), and write something about what you made, and what you took from elsewhere and changed, and where you used AI to help you generate code and ideas. Also list all the sources used (all video and sound footage) - where is it from, who made it?

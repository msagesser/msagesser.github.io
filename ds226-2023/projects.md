# DS226. Small Projects

**Assignment**  
"Small Projects" are considered the sum of small assignments that are conducted over the duration of this course. These include group and individual assignments, and they include creative, technical, academic, aesthetical, and presentation-related activities. What is graded is both the quality, the professionality, and each individual's committment to fulfilling the assignment. Over this course, in average there will be one "small project" per teaching day. These projects will always be announced as being part of the "small projects" grade.

**Small Project 1**
Create a small video (can be without sound) for the 8 LED panels in one row. Choose one of the three keywords – "waste," "obsolete," or "decayed" – and design an experience that responds to this keyword. The result should be a short video for a pixel resolution of 1280x80 that can be looped.

*Deadline for submitting the result to the submission folder: May 13, 23:59*

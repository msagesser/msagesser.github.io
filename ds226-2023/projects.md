# DS226. Small Projects

**Assignment**  
"Small Projects" are considered the sum of small assignments that are conducted over the duration of this course. These include group and individual assignments, and they include creative, technical, academic, aesthetical, and presentation-related activities. What is graded is both the quality, the professionality, and each individual's committment to fulfilling the assignment. Over this course, in average there will be one "small project" per teaching day. These projects will always be announced as being part of the "small projects" grade.

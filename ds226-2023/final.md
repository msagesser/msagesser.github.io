# DS226. Final Project Assignment

**Assignment**  
Realize a larger creative project, in a group, in which you apply the technical, conceptual, theoretical, and aesthetical skill you have learned in this course. The expected format is a video for a non-regular screen size, with accompanying sound, which creates an experience for an audience. Its lenght should be max 5 minutes. Choose a topic that has a strong connection to, or is inspired by, *e-waste*. Make use of a circular material economy, interpreted and explained by you and your group.


- Genre: experience design, digital media art
- Format Video: digital video for non-regular screen
- Format Audio: digital audio, 2-channel (stereo), mixed and mastered
- Topic: connected to, or inspired by, *e-waste*
- Methodological and Conceptual Approach: circular material economy
- Materials: found footage, self-recorded footage, and/or self-made footage
- Software: Recommended is Processing for video & sound processing and synthesis, Adobe Premiere for video editing, and Adobe Audition for sound editing, mixing, and mastering
- Length: maximum 5 minutes
- Public Presentation Criteria: video has to pass C Future City approval process for public showcase at mall

**Project parts made by the group**
- Final video with sound (grading criteria: technical realization, quality of concept, application of theory, aesthetical quality, team work, responsiveness to teacher's and peers' feedback in iterative revisions, crediting of sources and roles, and professionality of result)
- A strong, meaningful title for the work in English (grading criteria: responsiveness to iterative feedback procedure)
- Oral presentation of the final video on site at the C Future City on Day 8 (grading criteria: quality of presentation, professionality, team work)

**Project parts made by each group member**
- Concept note; a strong English text, explaining the conceptual, theoretical, and creative intervention that the project makes; maximum length is 250 words (grading criteria: logical structure of text, English grammar and spelling, quality of thought process, and overall professionality of the concept note)
- Individual project documentation: a longer PDF document that carefully documents the design process of this project. It is expected to contain the title, the concept note, group names, short bio of the group member, 3 or more video stills, most important software code, and a number of visual materials from the design process depending on the group member's preferences. These could cosist of drafts, drawings, flow charts, story boards, synopsis notes, mockups, visualizations, sound plans, musical scores, or many more. Each material used in the documentation has to indicate who made it, or where it is coming from. Materials by other group members can be used, if they are credited. Yet, each group member, in this documentation, should emphasise the parts that they put most effort in. (Grading criteria: conceptual quality of documentation, completeness, quality of the "narration" or readability for an outside audience, overall design of the PDF, and professionality of documentation)

**Timeline & Submissions**
- Day 1: Make groups
- Day 4: Interim Review with external experts (not graded): present a meaningful first draft or prototype of your project (expected presentation: play video with sound draft [max 3min], then present project with or without slides/pdf/graphics. Include the context, client, situation, overview, title, concept/idea, and how it relates to circular material economies, and to e-waste [presentation part max 5min]. Then, the experts will give comments [10min]).
- Day 5: meet Marcel for group office hour, present meaningful response to feedback from interim review
- Day 6: present second big draft of Final Project in class (include any updates of the concept, and include timeline that includes all project parts)

- Day 7: By 7:59am, present final project, including title, individual concept note; and then workshop all elements on this day in the classroom and potentially at the shopping mall (upload to "Final Project Draft3")
- Day 7: By 23:59, submit final video with sound for content approval to client (upload to "Final Project Draft4")
- Day 8: Final Review with external experts at C Future City

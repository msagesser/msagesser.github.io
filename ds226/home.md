# DS226. Circular Products: Experience
Spring 2022  
Major Elective Course  
Credits: 3  
64 total hours: 32 hours of lecture, 32 hours of lab  
Language: English  


## Instructor
Marcel Sagesser  
Assistant Professor in Media Arts and Technology  
School of Design, SUSTech, Shenzhen

## Course Description
In this course, students will learn the foundations of time-based digital media analysis and production. Using the framework of ‘cradle to cradle’ and circular economies, this course will ask how reusing and recycling of pre-existing materials might look like in digital media. Students will consider real-world situations for opportunities of design that require the production of time-based, intangible digital media experiences. In addition to receiving the basics of digital media editing, students will engage in English-language classroom discussion, they will work both individually and in groups, they will learn to analyze pre-existing digital media experiences, and they will receive demanding assignments to produce their own creative digital media experiences.

## Skills
Translational envisioning; reuse

## Learning Outcomes
1.	Describe ‘waste,’ ‘obsolete,’ and ‘decayed’ for materials across media and senses, in particular for intangible and time-based materials.
2.	Demonstrate understanding of ‘circular economies’ for time-based digital media, including the differences between synthesizing, reusing, recycling, referencing, citing, and appropriating.
3.	Define the difference between material/footage and process/mediation in time-based digital media.
4.	Present research of techniques that ‘translate’ ideas between multiple intangible materials.

## Course Overview

- [PDF full schedule](ds226-schedule-1.pdf)

### [Day #1: "Time"](day1.md)

Lecture (4 hours)
-	Welcome and course overview
-	Introduction: time-based digital media
-	Definitions and conversation: digital media, time, time-based

Practice (4 hours)
-	Small exercise: create time. Arrange given media objects on a timeline in software
-	Present a 30sec media clip to the class, describe your process, define ‘time’ by describing your media clip

### Day #2: "Experience I"

Lecture (4 hours)
-	Introduction: capturing an experience, recording and filming, image and sound
-	Examples: film, video and sound history, media arts history
-	Definition and conversation: experience, perception, immersion, senses

Practice (4 hours)
-	Small field trip: capture an experience outdoors on campus in groups of two. Record sound, and record image. Put sound and image together without any further editing; create an experience that has no cuts and no other editing than matching sound and image
-	Present a 30sec digital media product to the class

### Day #3: "Circular Economies: Material and Process"

Lecture (4 hours)
-	Introduction: reuse of existing materials, reprocess
-	Definitions and conversation: material, footage, process, mediation

Practice (4 hours)
-	Small exercise: collect pre-existing images and sounds. Categorize, archive, and describe your materials. Then, rearrange, recombine, remix and reprocess the materials in software
-	Present a 30sec clip to the class

### Day #4: "Waste"

Lecture (4 hours)
-	Introduction: waste, obsolete and decayed materials in time-based digital media
-	Definitions and conversation: waste, recycling, reuse, referencing, citing, appropriating

Practice (4 hours)
-	Small field trip: collect digital waste. Then, create a digital media experience (with image and sound) that explains and defines what ‘waste’ means to you. Choose and apply one of these concepts to your digital media experience: recycling, reusing, referencing, citing, or appropriating
-	Present a 30sec clip to the class
-	Interim review

### Day #5: "Synthesis"

Lecture (4 hours)
-	Introduction: synthesis as a technique to process materials, in digital image and sound production
-	Definition and conversation: synthesis

Practice (4 hours)
-	Small exercise: create one sound that changes slowly over time. Then, create one image that changes slowly over time, then put the two coincidentally together.
-	Present short media clip to the class

### Day #6: "Translation I: Sound and Image"

Lecture (4 hours)
-	Introduction: translate from old to new. Translate from sound to image. Translate ideas. Translate experiences
-	Definition and conversation: translation

Practice (4 hours)
-	Small exercise: create a storyboard for a translation process in sound and image. 
-	Present the storyboard to the class

### Day #7: "Translation II: Space, spatial experience"

Lecture (4 hours)
-	Introduction: how do we experience space through digital media? Techniques for creating spaces in sound and image. Reuse, recycle, reprocess and remix spaces in digital media
-	Definition and conversation: space
-	**Talk by guest artist: [Kyoka](http://www.ufunfunfufu.com/)**

Practice (4 hours)
-	Work on final project: apply everything that you have learned so far in this course and create a spatial experience based on a circular economy of footage. Length: between 5 – 10 min.

### Day #8: "Experience II"

Lecture (4 hours)
-	Conclusion: how has our understanding of ‘experience’ changed at the end of this course?
-	Discussion: experience and circular economies

Practice (4 hours)
-	Final presentation
-	Course feedback

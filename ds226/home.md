### Course Description
In this course, students will learn the foundations of time-based digital media analysis and production. Using the framework of ‘cradle to cradle’ and circular economies, this course will ask how reusing and recycling of pre-existing materials might look like in digital media. Students will consider real-world situations for opportunities of design that require the production of time-based, intangible digital media experiences. In addition to receiving the basics of digital media editing, students will engage in English-language classroom discussion, they will work both individually and in groups, they will learn to analyze pre-existing digital media experiences, and they will receive demanding assignments to produce their own creative digital media experiences.

### Skills

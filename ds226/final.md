# DS226. Final Project


Work on final project: apply everything that you have learned in this course and create a (spatial) experience (in image & sound) based on a circular economy of footage.  

- create a work of digital media art  
- create something abstract (textures that change slowly over time, in image and sound)
- put images and sounds together that were not together before
- use mostly pre-existing materials (circular economy: create something new out of something old)
- combine, edit, process, recombine, change, manipulate the media files in a creative way
- Try out some radical editing (“radical” means the edit itself becomes visible/audible; the edit becomes part of the content)
- Use some of the editing techniques we learned in this class:
  - looping / repeating
  - slowing down / speeding up
  - copying / collaging / multiplying
  - framing / selecting / cropping

   
- Length: between 5 – 10 min.

# DS226. Final Project


Work on final project: apply everything that you have learned in this course and create a (spatial) experience (in image & sound) based on a circular economy of footage.  

- create a work of digital media art  
- create something abstract (textures that change slowly over time, in image and sound)
- put images and sounds together that were not together before
- use mostly pre-existing materials (circular economy: create something new out of something old)
- combine, edit, process, recombine, change, manipulate the media files in a creative way
- Try out some radical editing (“radical” means the edit itself becomes visible/audible; the edit becomes part of the content)
- Use some of the editing techniques we learned in this class:
  - looping / repeating
  - slowing down / speeding up
  - copying / collaging / multiplying
  - framing / selecting / cropping

   
- Length: between 5 – 10 min.
  

### Part 1 - Homework (individually)

Homework week 1-2:  
- collect at least 2 raw digital materials (image or sound or both)  
- meet with Marcel for 10 minutes before the next class and present your brainstorming and at least two collected materials (image or sound or both)
- sign up for a meeting on the sign-up sheet on OneDrive by the end of May 11, 2022

### Part 2 - Homework

Homework week 2-3:  


Each groups meets with Marcel for 10min and presents a major project proposal including:  
- concept notes,
- methods,
- topic,
- academic research,
- catalog of materials,
- backgrounds and bios  

Sign up for a meeting on the sign-up sheet on OneDrive by the end of the day, May 18, 2022  

### Part 3 - Homework

Homework week 3-4:  

Homework:
Finish major part of your final project; finish recording and processing all materials; start post production.  

Meet with Marcel if necessary (meeting with Marcel is not mandatory this time)

### Part 4 - Process (group work)

Learning Objective 4:  
Present research of techniques that 'translate' ideas between multiple intangible materials.
Create your audio-visual work.

- Finish your project.
- Be sure to do postproduction (color correction, creative style, audio mixing, reverb)
- Export as 

*Upload to OneDrive by Tuesday May 31, 8pm*

### Part 5 - Presentation (group work + individual work)

Present your project in the final review to the invited audience (group work).   

Have a first version of your 'artist statement' ready (individual work). 

*Upload the text to Onedrive by Wednesday June 1, 11am*  
(upload as a .txt / .rtf / .docx file, put it in the folder: final project artist statement (draft))

Your text should contain:  

- what are circular materials in digital media?
- what are your materials?
- why, and how, are they circular? (or the result of a circular material economy?)
- what is your main concept (very short!)
- what did you learn from making this project (and from this class)? Name 1 thing!
- how did it change you as an _experience designer?_

### Part 6 - Documentation (individually)

Document your project, write a short 'artist statement', and submit it to OneDrive including accompanying documentary materials (sketches, drafts, drawings, notes, concept books, story boards, etc.)

# DS226. Assignment 3

## Part 1: collecting (groups of two)

Collect pre-existing images and sounds, according to the following rules:  

- "pre-existing" means that you record images and sounds that come out of another medium (a screen, a loudspeaker, etc.)
- every group records 5 sound files and 5 video files
- each recording should last between ~30sec and ~3min
- all video recordings with static camera (on tripod or similar)
- all sound recordings with static microphone (on tripod or similar)
- for each sound recording, take 1 photo of the recording location (can also show the microphone)


## Part 2: archiving (groups of two)

Classify and archive the material on the computer.  
Each of your 10 media files receives:  
- a name
- a category
- a short description
- duration of file
- 5 keywords
- authors
- one teaser image (1 frame of video, or 1 photo of sound recording location)  
  
Then:  
- upload the 10 media files to the shared folder of DS226 (OneDrive)
- insert your classifications into the shared Excel sheet  

## Part 3: remixing (individually)

Create an _abstract_ digital media collage using only:  
- 2 of your own sounds
- 2 of your own images
- 1 sound from another group (free choice)
- 1 image from another group (free choice)  
  
(abstract means that there should be no story, no concrete action, no text, no spoken language)  
  
Then:  
- combine, edit, process, recombine, change, manipulate the media files in a creative way
- You are only using pre-existing material, but the task is to create something new out of something old
- Try out some _radical_ editing
- For the image: try to create aesthetically interesting abstract textures that change (slowly) over time
- For the sound: try to create aesthetically interesting abstract textures that change (slowly) over time  

## Part 4: presenting (individually)

Present a 30sec digital media product to the class with image and sound.

## Digital Media

### What is 'digital media' according to Cathy van Eck and Paul Hegarty?
- van Eck: Digital media is a technological process that can input, store, transport, edit and output the information.
Hegarty: Digital media is to use binary computing to store, deliver information, and gives people the possibilities to sense the information. It even eliminates the distance between art and people.
Digial media is a set of stimulacra, it hastens the end of aything being outside of simulated reality. On the one hand, it is ubiquitous, as a normal technical procedure allowing high fidelity 'sharing' of material.  On the other hand, it has introduced fundamental social change, signaling a change in functionality of artworks.

- Tony Feldman: Digital media helps the novice along and focuses on the implications of the digital revolution, and creates new hybrid channels of delivery.

- Digital networks influence print books, and print traditions inform the ways in which the materiality of digital objects is understood and theorized. Thus two dynamics are at work: one in which the Digital Humanities are moving forward to open up new areas of exploration, and another in which they are engaged in a recursive feedback loop with the Traditional Humanities.

- Digital media belongs to engineering discipline and refers to the information carrier of recording, processing, transmission and acquisition process in the form of binary numbers. These carriers include digital text, graphics, images, sound, video, animation and other sensory media, and the representation media (coding) to represent these sensory media, commonly known as logical media, as well as storage, transmission, display logical media physical media.


### What is 'digital media' according to yourself?

- Digital media is to use art pieces and codes to deal with information, including getting, editting, delivering.
- Personal thinking: Digital media provides a way that have more possibility. More people can access and edit the same thing. And it doesn’t have some physical limitation. It blurs the concept of time to some extent(?).

## Time
### What is 'time' according to Cathy van Eck and Paul Hegarty?

- Hegarty：Time is a passage towards total simulation. Time makes people further believe in high fidelity reproduction and seek for storage methods.

- van Eck: Time is one type of data to together describe the variation of air pressure, which is used to enables vibrations in sound making.

- what is time in the artical " Time in Simulation and Real Time Simulation "?Time has two types, one is real time in life, which can’t be changed but only record, one is the simulation time within the machine system, which is based on the impulse frequency and can be adjusted depending on our needs.

### What is 'time' according to yourself?

- Time scares people, Let people be cautious, cherish and enjoy the presen. Let people reflect and progress because of fear to time.


- For human, time is a variable existing in feelings and memories. That variable makes people feel the changes of other variables.

- For mashines or the virtual world, people can control the time to control the world, but should depend on the conditions of devices or logic of systems.

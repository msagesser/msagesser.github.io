## Digital Media

### What is 'digital media' according to Cathy van Eck and Paul Hegarty?
- van Eck: Digital media is a technological process that can input, store, transport, edit and output the information.
Hegarty: Digital media is to use binary computing to store, deliver information, and gives people the possibilities to sense the information. It even eliminates the distance between art and people.
Digial media is a set of stimulacra, it hastens the end of aything being outside of simulated reality. On the one hand, it is ubiquitous, as a normal technical procedure allowing high fidelity 'sharing' of material.  On the other hand, it has introduced fundamental social change, signaling a change in functionality of artworks.

- Digital networks influence print books, and print traditions inform the ways in which the materiality of digital objects is understood and theorized. Thus two dynamics are at work: one in which the Digital Humanities are moving forward to open up new areas of exploration, and another in which they are engaged in a recursive feedback loop with the Traditional Humanities.

- Digital media belongs to engineering discipline and refers to the information carrier of recording, processing, transmission and acquisition process in the form of binary numbers. These carriers include digital text, graphics, images, sound, video, animation and other sensory media, and the representation media (coding) to represent these sensory media, commonly known as logical media, as well as storage, transmission, display logical media physical media.


### What is 'digital media' according to yourself?

- Digital media is to use art pieces and codes to deal with information, including getting, editting, delivering.

- Personal thinking: Digital media provides a way that have more possibility. More people can access and edit the same thing. And it doesn’t have some physical limitation. It blurs the concept of time to some extent(?).

## Time
### What is 'time' according to Cathy van Eck and Paul Hegarty?

- Hegarty：Time is a passage towards total simulation. Time makes people further believe in high fidelity reproduction and seek for storage methods.

### what is 'time' according to 1 other academic source?

- what is time in the artical " Time in Simulation and Real Time Simulation "?Time has two types, one is real time in life, which can’t be changed but only record, one is the simulation time within the machine system, which is based on the impulse frequency and can be adjusted depending on our needs.

### What is 'time' according to yourself?

- Time scares people, Let people be cautious, cherish and enjoy the presen. Let people reflect and progress because of fear to time.

- For human, time is a variable existing in feelings and memories. That variable makes people feel the changes of other variables.

- For mashines or the virtual world, people can control the time to control the world, but should depend on the conditions of devices or logic of systems.





## Time-Based
### What is 'time-based' according to academic sources?


- The definition of time-based media in WIKI say that Contemporary artworks that include video, film, slide, audio, or computer-based technologies are referred to as time-based media works because they have duration as a dimension and unfold to the viewer over time.

 

- Based on this definition, video is a typical example that have its own time to record and show. But we also consider novels, paintings, and photos that probably have its infinite time, from different viewing choice. That is, once an audience can choose to  stop reading a comic book and it would stop at a certain scene, then the time for this comic book to this viewer can be frozen, and may be kinds of time-based(widely, generalized). Also, the capture movement in a world of shifting temporaries and oscillating identities can have a relationship.

 

- For this form of artworks, people should focus on four specific areas of activity in the time-based art life cycle: Acquisition Documentation; Installation, display, and access; and Preservation. In practice, of course, these areas are fundamentally integrated at many levels, and cannot be addressed in isolation.

 

- As for preservation and display, as the time pass by, there are problems for this time-based media. On the one hand, we have to try to find way to storage them, archiving and display alike. With development of technology, the digital media can storage in high quality. However the way to storage a time-based artworks can sometimes be undermine the 'record industry' or its film equivalent. It is about the way to storage them, when using high technology, some digital media is required so the outcome to present in front of viewer have passed through lots of screens, re-organized methods and so on. That can change the time-based media itself, partly different from the original one. On the other hands, very accuracy of re-presentation can make the time-based artworks lose its trace of time. In total screen by Ryoji Ikeda, Carsten Nicolai, Granular Synthesis said that by manipulation of the supposedly perfect disc, which could then be ironically displayed in triumphal accuracy on a finished CD (without the sanctification of the properly functioning finished product, glitching would be heard only as mistake). I think respect time, preserve the trace of time and view the time trace can be part of the artworks. Re-presentation allows sharing, but the things it shares are no longer the original artworks. As time passes by, perhaps the low quality from today’s view is a kind of present of time-based, based on real time to tell the viewer what the artworks have pass through.

 

- We also see some essays talk about organizations try to understand the initial expression from artists to better choose a way to storage time-based media.

- Time-based media conservation aims to determine and monitor the acceptable degree of short-, middle-, and long-term change that an artwork may undergo in response to different display environments, technological developments, curatorial and exhibition-design concepts, or technicians’ preferences. To understand and preserve a work of media art, the responsible conservator considers the artist’s intention as well as the work’s technical components and analyzes the relationship between the two. Whether and how a device or technology can be exchanged will depend on its significance to the individual artwork. To make an informed assessment, the conservator must fully understand the function and characteristics of involved technologies and identify their specific impact on the artwork’s aesthetic, conceptual, and historical identity.



- it's interesting to see different art forms are time-based differently. like music, film, they are totally time-based. E.g. film is somehow time-based double times, because its raw material is video clips which is time-based and its most important expression form is editting, montage, which is also basically play tricks with time. https://b23.tv/IW5tbph

- but paint, sculpture, photography are not time-based. they don't contain a time axis, they are about a solid moment. but it doesn't mean they don't deal with time as an element.. E.g. "the decisive moment" theory of Bresson, a photographer:

- "Behind the Gare Saint-Lazare, Paris, 1932", "make the solid moment have the potential to move", https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1o34y1X7Ah?share_source=copy_web

- e.g. Apollo and Daphne,Gianlorenzo Bernini,1622-1623

- JoJo stand, Hirohiko Araki, https://img0.baidu.com/it/u=2694020965,2665911423&fm=253&fmt=auto&app=138&f=JPEG?w=445&h=480

- lack of a time line is the obstacle of these art forms. but one of the greatest forces of art is to break the obstacle. and the most interesting way of dealing with time is in literature and comics. they has a read sequency, but how to read them is all depended on the readers.

- e.g.  "harry in the movie" when harry met sally, 1989. because he didn't know which came first, last page or his death

- Composition n°1, Marc Saporta, 1962, a novel composed with 500 separated pages, you can change their sequence before you read, like shuffle cards when playing pokers, so each time you will read a whole different story.

- Time-based artworks that include video, film, slide, audio, or computer technologies are referred to as time-based media works because they have duration as a dimension and unfold to the viewer over time. Collecting, preserving, and exhibiting these artworks poses complex technical and ethical challenges to conservators.----https://www.guggenheim.org/conservation/time-based-media

- Contemporary artworks that include video, film, slide, audio, or computer technologies are referred to as time-based media works because they have duration as a dimension and unfold to the viewer over time. (https://www.guggenheim.org/conservation/time-based-media)

- Among the descriptors identifying a traditional artwork are its dimensions, measured as height by length by depth. With many contemporary artworks, these physical dimensions are variable. Time-based media is a term that we use to summarize those artworks that have duration as a dimension, e.g. “four minutes and 33 seconds.” (www.guggenheim.org/blogs/checklist/what-is-time-based-media-a-q-and-a-with-guggenheim-conservator-joanna-phillips/)

- "Although numerous past contemporary African art exhibits have included time-based materials, Roberts's decision to isolate the medium emphasized its ability to capture movement in a world of shifting temporalities and oscillating identities." (https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/A247340072/AONE)

- "However, despite the exhibit's broad geological premise, it was the mode of expression, the time-based medium, that truly unified the selected works. Unlike the many exhibits that address ideas of Africa, "Continental Rifts" critically explored a medium and how its intrinsic qualities facilitate a reassessment of ongoing debates on African art. Hence, while the works' medium was constant, their content was wide-ranging. From Jaar's video of a war-torn Angola to Barrada's photographs of the burgeoning tourist industry in Tangier, it was the inclusion of a multiplicity of voices that defied categorization and shattered stereotypes of an undifferentiated Africa."

- "As the Fowler Museum's first show dedicated exclusively to time-based media, 'Continental Rifts' brought together the film, video, and photography of five acclaimed contemporary artists who explored shifting notions of identity in a transnational world. Mary (Polly) Nooter Roberts, the former deputy director and chief curator of the Fowler, selected works by Yto Barrada, Claudia Cristovao, Alfredo Jaar, Georgia Papageorge, and Berni Searle to explore the physical and conceptual boundaries that characterize understandings of Africa."

### What is 'time-based' according to yourself?


- In my understanding, Time-base artwork is a form of presentation based on time changes. For example, play a movie. The effect is especially evident in the editing of films, where editors manipulate the timeline by reversing the sequence of shots. The timeline shown to the audience changes accordingly. This kind of work has more tension.I would like to use painting as a comparation.

- Painting is usually not time based because it is static and in a short period of time, it would not change as time flows. Painting also has its advantage. We can appreciate it for a long "time". (We are used to pause a film from time to time )

- We should also note that the digital aspect sometimes cancels the time-based of the material itself. For example, the physical properties of a photo (or painting) in reality will change over time (become"old" physically).  However, when the photo is digitized, it no longer had this layer of properties. To a certain extent, the preservation of digital form makes it lose its physical timebase attribute, making it less authentic.

- Time-based media is the media that has the property of time as an integrated property of existence, storage, expression, and so on. For the time-based content, what can be observed change with elapsing of time, and by observing continuously in the dimension of time , what the observer gets can be different from only observing for a certain instant stayed moment.
